# Two Integer Sum II

# Problem

You are given a 1-indexed sorted array of integers numbers and a target integer target.
Your task is to find two distinct numbers in the array that add up to the target number.

Return the indices (1-based) of the two numbers as an integer array [index1, index2].

You may assume that:

Each input has exactly one solution.

You cannot use the same element twice.

The input array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

ðŸ§  Example

Input:

numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9


Output:

[1, 2]


Explanation:

2 + 7 = 9

Since array indices start at 1 in this problem, we return [1, 2].

# Solution Description

Because the array is sorted, we can use the two-pointer technique to efficiently find the two numbers that sum to the target.

Start with two pointers:

left pointing at the first element.

right pointing at the last element.

Compute the sum:
sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]

Compare the sum to the target:

If sum == target â†’ we found our pair â†’ return [left + 1, right + 1]

If sum < target â†’ sum is too small â†’ move left pointer to the right

If sum > target â†’ sum is too large â†’ move right pointer to the left

Continue until the pair is found (guaranteed to exist).

This works because moving pointers adjusts the sum intelligently:

Moving left â†’ increases the total sum.

Moving right â†’ decreases the total sum.

# Complexity Analysist

### Time Complexity - O(n)

Each element is visited at most once as left and right move toward each other.

### Space Complexity - O(1)

Only a few integer variables are used; no extra data structures needed.
