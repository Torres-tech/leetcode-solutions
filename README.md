# LeetCode Solutions

This repository is where I upload my solutions to LeetCode algorithm problems.
  
All problems are separated logically by topic (e.g., arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.).  

The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice problem-solving daily
- Improve my Java coding skills
- Build a well-organized reference for interview preparation
